abstract = {We present a rapid experimental strategy for inferring base pairs in structured RNAs via an information-rich extension of classic chemical mapping approaches. The mutate-and-map method, previously applied to a DNA/RNA helix, systematically searches for single mutations that enhance the chemical accessibility of base-pairing partners distant in sequence. To test this strategy for structured RNAs, we have carried out mutate-and-map measurements for a 35-nt hairpin, called the MedLoop RNA, embedded within an 80-nt sequence. We demonstrate the synthesis of all 105 single mutants of the MedLoop RNA sequence and present high-throughput DMS, CMCT, and SHAPE modification measurements for this library at single-nucleotide resolution. The resulting two-dimensional data reveal visually clear, punctate features corresponding to RNA base pair interactions as well as more complex features; these signals can be qualitatively rationalized by comparison to secondary structure predictions. Finally, we present an automated, sequence-blind analysis that permits the confident identification of nine of the 10 MedLoop RNA base pairs at single-nucleotide resolution, while discriminating against all 1460 false-positive base pairs. These results establish the accuracy and information content of the mutate-and-map strategy and support its feasibility for rapidly characterizing the base-pairing patterns of larger and more complex RNA systems.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNA molecules fold into precise base pairing patterns to carry out critical roles in genetic regulation and protein synthesis. We show here that coupling systematic mutagenesis with high-throughput SHAPE chemical mapping enables accurate base pair inference of domains from ribosomal RNA, ribozymes, and riboswitches. For a six-RNA benchmark that challenged prior chemical/computational methods, this mutate-and-map strategy gives secondary structures in agreement with crystallographic data (2 \% error rates), including a blind test on a double-glycine riboswitch. Through modeling of partially ordered RNA states, the method enables the first test of an 'interdomain helix-swap' hypothesis for ligand-binding cooperativity in a glycine riboswitch. Finally, the mutate-and-map data report on tertiary contacts within non-coding RNAs; coupled with the Rosetta/FARFAR algorithm, these data give nucleotide-resolution three-dimensional models (5.7 AA helix RMSD) of an adenine riboswitch. These results highlight the promise of a two-dimensional chemical strategy for inferring the secondary and tertiary structures that underlie non-coding RNA behavior.},

abstract = {The structure of the 5' domain of yeast 18S rRNA has been probed by dimethyl sulfate (DMS), either in "native" deproteinized molecules or in the 40S ribosomal subunits. DMS-reacted RNA has been used as a template for reverse transcription and a large number of reactive sites, corresponding to all types of bases have been mapped by a primer extension procedure, taking advantage of blocks in cDNA elongation immediately upstream from bases methylated at atom positions involved in the base-pair recognition of the template. Since the same atom positions are protected from DMS in base-paired nucleotides, the secondary structure status of each nucleotide can be directly assessed in this procedure, thus allowing to evaluate the potential contribution of proteins in modulating subunit rRNA conformation. While the DMS probing of deproteinized rRNA confirms a number of helical stems predicted by phylogenetic comparisons, it is remarkable that a few additional base-pairings, while proven by the comparative analysis, appear to require the presence of the bound ribosomal subunit proteins to be stabilized},

abstract = {New regulatory roles continue to emerge for both natural and engineered noncoding RNAs, many of which have specific secondary and tertiary structures essential to their function. Thus there is a growing need to develop technologies that enable rapid characterization of structural features within complex RNA populations. We have developed a high-throughput technique, SHAPE-Seq, that can simultaneously measure quantitative, single nucleotide-resolution secondary and tertiary structural information for hundreds of RNA molecules of arbitrary sequence. SHAPE-Seq combines selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) chemistry with multiplexed paired-end deep sequencing of primer extension products. This generates millions of sequencing reads, which are then analyzed using a fully automated data analysis pipeline, based on a rigorous maximum likelihood model of the SHAPE-Seq experiment. We demonstrate the ability of SHAPE-Seq to accurately infer secondary and tertiary structural information, detect subtle conformational changes due to single nucleotide point mutations, and simultaneously measure the structures of a complex pool of different RNA molecules. SHAPE-Seq thus represents a powerful step toward making the study of RNA secondary and tertiary structures high throughput and accessible to a wide array of scientific pursuits, from fundamental biological investigations to engineering RNA for synthetic biological systems.},

Here, we incorporate DMS data into automated secondary structure inference using an energy minimization framework developed for 2'-OH acylation (SHAPE) mapping. On six noncoding RNAs with crystallographic models, DMS-guided modeling achieves overall false negative and false discovery rates of 9.5\% and 11.6\%, respectively, comparable to or better than those of SHAPE-guided modeling, and bootstrapping provides straightforward confidence estimates. Integrating DMS-SHAPE data and including 1-cyclohexyl(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate (CMCT) reactivities provide small additional improvements. These results establish DMS mapping, an already routine technique, as a quantitative tool for unbiased RNA secondary structure modeling.},

abstract = {Hammerhead ribozymes are small self-cleaving RNAs that promote strand scission by internal phosphoester transfer. Comparative sequence analysis was used to identify numerous additional representatives of this ribozyme class than were previously known, including the first representatives in fungi and archaea. Moreover, we have uncovered the first natural examples of "type II" hammerheads, and our findings reveal that this permuted form occurs in bacteria as frequently as type I and III architectures. We also identified a commonly occurring pseudoknot that forms a tertiary interaction critical for high-speed ribozyme activity. Genomic contexts of many hammerhead ribozymes indicate that they perform biological functions different from their known role in generating unit-length RNA transcripts of multimeric viroid and satellite virus genomes. In rare instances, nucleotide variation occurs at positions within the catalytic core that are otherwise strictly conserved, suggesting that core mutations are occasionally tolerated or preferred.},

We achieve the throughput and data quality necessary for genomic-scale structural analysis by combining fluorophore labeling of nucleic acids with novel quantitation algorithms. We implemented these algorithms in the CAFA (capillary automated footprinting analysis) open-source software that is downloadable gratis from https://simtk.org/home/cafa. The accuracy, throughput and reproducibility of CAFA analysis are demonstrated using hydroxyl radical footprinting of RNA. The versatility of CAFA is illustrated by dimethyl sulfate mapping of RNA secondary structure and DNase I mapping of a protein binding to a specific sequence of DNA. Our experimental and computational approach facilitates the acquisition of high-throughput chemical probing data for solution structural analysis of nucleic acids.},

@article{Jonikas2009,
abstract = {Understanding the function of complex RNA molecules depends critically on understanding their structure. However, creating three-dimensional (3D) structural models of RNA remains a significant challenge. We present a protocol (the nucleic acid simulation tool [NAST]) for RNA modeling that uses an RNA-specific knowledge-based potential in a coarse-grained molecular dynamics engine to generate plausible 3D structures. We demonstrate NAST's capabilities by using only secondary structure and tertiary contact predictions to generate, cluster, and rank structures. Representative structures in the best ranking clusters averaged 8.0 +/- 0.3 A and 16.3 +/- 1.0 A RMSD for the yeast phenylalanine tRNA and the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, respectively. The coarse-grained resolution allows us to model large molecules such as the 158-residue P4-P6 or the 388-residue T. thermophila group I intron. One advantage of NAST is the ability to rank clusters of structurally similar decoys based on their compatibility with experimental data. We successfully used ideal small-angle X-ray scattering data and both ideal and experimental solvent accessibility data to select the best cluster of structures for both tRNA and P4-P6. Finally, we used NAST to build in missing loops in the crystal structures of the Azoarcus and Twort ribozymes, and to incorporate crystallographic data into the Michel-Westhof model of the T. thermophila group I intron, creating an integrated model of the entire molecule. Our software package is freely available at https://simtk.org/home/nast.},

In the 160-nucleotide domain, a sharp bend allows stacked helices of the conserved core to pack alongside helices of an adjacent region. Two specific long-range interactions clamp the two halves of the domain together: a two-Mg2+-coordinated adenosine-rich corkscrew plugs into the minor groove of a helix, and a GAAA hairpin loop binds to a conserved 11-nucleotide internal loop. Metal- and ribose-mediated backbone contacts further stabilize the close side-by-side helical packing. The structure indicates the extent of RNA packing required for the function of large ribozymes, the spliceosome, and the ribosome.},

abstract = {Synthetic RNA control devices that use ribozymes as gene-regulatory components have been applied to controlling cellular behaviors in response to environmental signals. Quantitative measurement of the in vitro cleavage rate constants associated with ribozyme-based devices is essential for advancing the molecular design and optimization of this class of gene-regulatory devices. One of the key challenges encountered in ribozyme characterization is the efficient generation of full-length RNA from in vitro transcription reactions, where conditions generally lead to significant ribozyme cleavage. Current methods for generating full-length ribozyme-encoding RNA rely on a trans-blocking strategy, which requires a laborious gel separation and extraction step. Here, we develop a simple two-step gel-free process including cis-blocking and trans-activation steps to support scalable generation of functional full-length ribozyme-encoding RNA. We demonstrate our strategy on various types of natural ribozymes and synthetic ribozyme devices, and the cleavage rate constants obtained for the RNA generated from our strategy are comparable with those generated through traditional methods. We further develop a rapid, label-free ribozyme cleavage assay based on surface plasmon resonance, which allows continuous, real-time monitoring of ribozyme cleavage. The surface plasmon resonance-based characterization assay will complement the versatile cis-blocking and trans-activation strategy to broadly advance our ability to characterize and engineer ribozyme-based devices.},

abstract = {Metabolite-sensing mRNAs, or "riboswitches," specifically interact with small ligands and direct expression of the genes involved in their metabolism. Riboswitches contain sensing "aptamer" modules, capable of ligand-induced structural changes, and downstream regions, harboring expression-controlling elements. We report the crystal structures of the add A-riboswitch and xpt G-riboswitch aptamer modules that distinguish between bound adenine and guanine with exquisite specificity and modulate expression of two different sets of genes. The riboswitches form tuning fork-like architectures, in which the prongs are held in parallel through hairpin loop interactions, and the internal bubble zippers up to form the purine binding pocket. The bound purines are held by hydrogen bonding interactions involving conserved nucleotides along their entire periphery. Recognition specificity is associated with Watson-Crick pairing of the encapsulated adenine and guanine ligands with uridine and cytosine, respectively.},

abstract = {Motivation: Capillary electrophoresis (CE) of nucleic acids is a workhorse technology underlying high-throughput genome analysis and large-scale chemical mapping for nucleic acid structural inference. Despite the wide availability of CE-based instruments, there remain challenges in leveraging their full power for quantitative analysis of RNA and DNA structure, thermodynamics and kinetics. In particular, the slow rate and poor automation of available analysis tools have bottlenecked a new generation of studies involving hundreds of CE profiles per experiment.  Results: We propose a computational method called high-throughput robust analysis for capillary electrophoresis (HiTRACE) to automate the key tasks in large-scale nucleic acid CE analysis, including the profile alignment that has heretofore been a rate-limiting step in the highest throughput experiments. We illustrate the application of HiTRACE on 13 datasets representing 4 different RNAs, 3 chemical modification strategies and up to 480 single mutant variants; the largest datasets each include 87 360 bands. By applying a series of robust dynamic programming algorithms, HiTRACE outperforms prior tools in terms of alignment and fitting quality, as assessed by measures including the correlation between quantified band intensities between replicate datasets. Furthermore, while the smallest of these datasets required 7-10 h of manual intervention using prior approaches, HiTRACE quantitation of even the largest datasets herein was achieved in 3-12 min. The HiTRACE method, therefore, resolves a critical barrier to the efficient and accurate analysis of nucleic acid structure in experiments involving tens of thousands of electrophoretic bands.  Availability: HiTRACE is freely available for download at http://hitrace.stanford.edu.

abstract = {A novel application of dynamic programming to the folding problem for RNA enables one to calculate the full equilibrium partition function for secondary structure and the probabilities of various substructures. In particular, both the partition function and the probabilities of all base pairs are computed by a recursive scheme of polynomial order N3 in the sequence length N. The temperature dependence of the partition function gives information about melting behavior for the secondary structure. The pair binding probabilities, the computation of which depends on the partition function, are visually summarized in a "box matrix" display and this provides a useful tool for examining the full ensemble of probable alternative equilibrium structures. The calculation of this ensemble representation allows a proper application and assessment of the predictive power of the secondary structure method, and yields important information on alternatives and intermediates in addition to local information about base pair opening and slippage. The results are illustrated for representative tRNA, 5S RNA, and self-replicating and self-splicing RNA molecules, and allow a direct comparison with enzymatic structure probes. The effect of changes in the thermodynamic parameters on the equilibrium ensemble provides a further sensitivity check to the predictions.},

abstract = {Non-coding RNAs fold into precise base-pairing patterns to carry out critical roles in genetic regulation and protein synthesis, but determining RNA structure remains difficult. Here, we show that coupling systematic mutagenesis with high-throughput chemical mapping enables accurate base-pair inference of domains from ribosomal RNA, ribozymes and riboswitches. For a six-RNA benchmark that has challenged previous chemical/computational methods, this 'mutate-and-map' strategy gives secondary structures that are in agreement with crystallography (helix error rates, 2\%), including a blind test on a double-glycine riboswitch. Through modelling of partially ordered states, the method enables the first test of an interdomain helix-swap hypothesis for ligand-binding cooperativity in a glycine riboswitch. Finally, the data report on tertiary contacts within non-coding RNAs, and coupling to the Rosetta/FARFAR algorithm gives nucleotide-resolution three-dimensional models (helix root-mean-squared deviation, 5.7 \AA) of an adenine riboswitch. These results establish a promising two-dimensional chemical strategy for inferring the secondary and tertiary structures that underlie non-coding RNA behaviour.},

abstract = {The increasing importance of non-coding RNA in biology and medicine has led to a growing interest in the problem of RNA 3-D structure prediction. As is the case for proteins, RNA 3-D structure prediction methods require two key ingredients: an accurate energy function and a conformational sampling procedure. Both are only partly solved problems. Here, we focus on the problem of conformational sampling. The current state of the art solution is based on fragment assembly methods, which construct plausible conformations by stringing together short fragments obtained from experimental structures. However, the discrete nature of the fragments necessitates the use of carefully tuned, unphysical energy functions, and their non-probabilistic nature impairs unbiased sampling. We offer a solution to the sampling problem that removes these important limitations: a probabilistic model of RNA structure that allows efficient sampling of RNA conformations in continuous space, and with associated probabilities. We show that the model captures several key features of RNA structure, such as its rotameric nature and the distribution of the helix lengths. Furthermore, the model readily generates native-like 3-D conformations for 9 out of 10 test structures, solely using coarse-grained base-pairing information. In conclusion, the method provides a theoretical and practical solution for a major bottleneck on the way to routine prediction and simulation of RNA structure and dynamics in atomic detail.},

abstract = {Structured RNAs achieve their active states by traversing complex, multidimensional energetic landscapes. Here we probe the folding landscape of the Tetrahymena ribozyme by using a powerful approach: the folding of single ribozyme molecules is followed beginning from distinct regions of the folding landscape. The experiments, combined with small-angle x-ray scattering results, show that the landscape contains discrete folding pathways. These pathways are separated by large free-energy barriers that prevent interconversion between them, indicating that the pathways lie in deep channels in the folding landscape. Chemical protection and mutagenesis experiments are then used to elucidate the structural features that determine which folding pathway is followed. Strikingly, a specific long-range tertiary contact can either help folding or hinder folding, depending on when it is formed during the process. Together these results provide an unprecedented view of the topology of an RNA folding landscape and the RNA structural features that underlie this multidimensional landscape.},

abstract = {RNA tertiary structure prediction has been based almost entirely on base-pairing constraints derived from phylogenetic covariation analysis. We describe here a complementary approach, inspired by the Rosetta low-resolution protein structure prediction method, that seeks the lowest energy tertiary structure for a given RNA sequence without using evolutionary information. In a benchmark test of 20 RNA sequences with known structure and lengths of approximately 30 nt, the new method reproduces better than 90\% of Watson-Crick base pairs, comparable with the accuracy of secondary structure prediction methods. In more than half the cases, at least one of the top five models agrees with the native structure to better than 4 A rmsd over the backbone. Most importantly, the method recapitulates more than one-third of non-Watson-Crick base pairs seen in the native structures. Tandem stacks of "sheared" base pairs, base triplets, and pseudoknots are among the noncanonical features reproduced in the models. In the cases in which none of the top five models were native-like, higher energy conformations similar to the native structures are still sampled frequently but not assigned low energies. These results suggest that modest improvements in the energy function, together with the incorporation of information from phylogenetic covariance, may allow confident and accurate structure prediction for larger and more complex RNA chains.},

RNAs that carry the consensus sequence and structural features of guanine riboswitches are located in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of numerous prokaryotic genes, where they control the expression of proteins involved in purine salvage and biosynthesis. We report that three representatives of this riboswitch class bind adenine with values for apparent dissociation constant (apparent K(d)) that are several orders of magnitude lower than those for binding guanine. Because preference for adenine is attributable to a single nucleotide substitution, the RNA most likely recognizes its ligand by forming a Watson-Crick base pair. In addition, the adenine riboswitch associated with the ydhL gene of Bacillus subtilis functions as a genetic 'on' switch, wherein adenine binding causes a structural rearrangement that precludes formation of an intrinsic transcription terminator stem.},

abstract = {A dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure has been revised to accommodate folding constraints determined by chemical modification and to include free energy increments for coaxial stacking of helices when they are either adjacent or separated by a single mismatch. Furthermore, free energy parameters are revised to account for recent experimental results for terminal mismatches and hairpin, bulge, internal, and multibranch loops. To demonstrate the applicability of this method, in vivo modification was performed on 5S rRNA in both Escherichia coli and Candida albicans with 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate, dimethyl sulfate, and kethoxal. The percentage of known base pairs in the predicted structure increased from 26.3\% to 86.8\% for the E. coli sequence by using modification constraints. For C. albicans, the accuracy remained 87.5\% both with and without modification data. On average, for these sequences and a set of 14 sequences with known secondary structure and chemical modification data taken from the literature, accuracy improves from 67\% to 76\%. This enhancement primarily reflects improvement for three sequences that are predicted with <40\% accuracy on the basis of energetics alone. For these sequences, inclusion of chemical modification constraints improves the average accuracy from 28\% to 78\%. For the 11 sequences with <6\% pseudoknotted base pairs, structures predicted with constraints from chemical modification contain on average 84\% of known canonical base pairs.},

abstract = {Prediction of RNA secondary structure by free energy minimization has been the standard for over two decades. Here we describe a novel method that forsakes this paradigm for predictions based on Boltzmann-weighted structure ensemble. We introduce the notion of a centroid structure as a representative for a set of structures and describe a procedure for its identification. In comparison with the minimum free energy (MFE) structure using diverse types of structural RNAs, the centroid of the ensemble makes 30.0\% fewer prediction errors as measured by the positive predictive value (PPV) with marginally improved sensitivity. The Boltzmann ensemble can be separated into a small number (3.2 on average) of clusters. Among the centroids of these clusters, the "best cluster centroid" as determined by comparison to the known structure simultaneously improves PPV by 46.5\% and sensitivity by 21.7\%. For 58\% of the studied sequences for which the MFE structure is outside the cluster containing the best centroid, the improvements by the best centroid are 62.5\% for PPV and 31.4\% for sensitivity. These results suggest that the energy well containing the MFE structure under the current incomplete energy model is often different from the one for the unavailable complete model that presumably contains the unique native structure. Centroids are available on the Sfold server at http://sfold.wadsworth.org.},

abstract = {To understand how the U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) interacts with other spliceosome components, its structure and binding to the U4/U6 snRNP were analyzed. The interaction of the U5 snRNP with the U4/U6 snRNP was studied by separating the snRNPs in HeLa cell nuclear extracts on glycerol gradients. A complex running at 25S and containing U4, U5, and U6 but not U1 or U2 snRNAs was identified. In contrast to results with native gel electrophoresis to separate snRNPs, this U4/U5/U6 snRNP complex requires ATP to assemble from the individual snRNPs. The structure of the U5 RNA within the U5 snRNP and the U4/5/6 snRNP complexes was then compared. Oligonucleotide-targeted RNase H digestion identified one RNA sequence in the U5 snRNP capable of base pairing to other nucleic acid sequences. Chemical modification experiments identified this sequence as well as two other U5 RNA sequences as accessible to modification within the U5 RNP. One of these regions is a large loop in the U5 RNA secondary structure whose sequence is conserved from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to humans. Interestingly, no differences in modification of free U5 snRNP as compared to U5 in the U4/U5/U6 snRNP complex were observed, suggesting that recognition of specific RNA sequences in the U5 snRNP is not required for U4/U5/U6 snRNP assembly.},

abstract = {Examples of small self-cleaving RNAs embedded in noncoding regions already have been found to be involved in the control of gene expression, although their origin remains uncertain. In this work, we show the widespread occurrence of the hammerhead ribozyme (HHR) motif among genomes from the Bacteria, Chromalveolata, Plantae, and Metazoa kingdoms. Intergenic HHRs were detected in three different bacterial genomes, whereas metagenomic data from Galapagos Islands showed the occurrence of similar ribozymes that could be regarded as direct relics from the RNA world. Among eukaryotes, HHRs were detected in the genomes of three water molds as well as 20 plant species, ranging from unicellular algae to vascular plants. These HHRs were very similar to those previously described in small RNA plant pathogens and, in some cases, appeared as close tandem repetitions. A parallel situation of tandemly repeated HHR motifs was also detected in the genomes of lower metazoans from cnidarians to invertebrates, with special emphasis among hematophagous and parasitic organisms. Altogether, these findings unveil the HHR as a widespread motif in DNA genomes, which would be involved in new forms of retrotransposable elements.},

abstract = {The plasticity of viral plus strand RNA genomes is fundamental for the multiple functions of these molecules. Local and long-range RNA-RNA interactions provide the scaffold for interacting proteins of the translation, replication, and encapsidation machinery. Using dengue virus as a model, we investigated the relevance of the interplay between two alternative conformations of the viral genome during replication. Flaviviruses require long-range RNA-RNA interactions and genome cyclization for RNA synthesis. Here, we define a sequence present in the viral 3'UTR that overlaps two mutually exclusive structures. This sequence can form an extended duplex by long-range 5'-3' interactions in the circular conformation of the RNA or fold locally into a small hairpin (sHP) in the linear form of the genome. A mutational analysis of the sHP structure revealed an absolute requirement of this element for viral viability, suggesting the need of a linear conformation of the genome. Viral RNA replication showed high vulnerability to changes that alter the balance between circular and linear forms of the RNA. Mutations that shift the equilibrium toward the circular or the linear conformation of the genome spontaneously revert to sequences with different mutations that tend to restore the relative stability of the two competing structures. We propose a model in which the viral genome exists in at least two alternative conformations and the balance between these two states is critical for infectivity.},

abstract = {Long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as important regulatory factors in mammalian genomics. A number of reports within the last 2 years have identified thousands of actively expressed long ncRNA transcripts with distinct properties. The long ncRNAs show differential expression patterns and regulation in a wide variety of cells and tissues, adding significant complexity to the understanding of their biological role. Furthermore, genome-wide studies of transcriptional enhancers based on chromatin modifications and enhancer binding proteins have led to the identification of putative enhancers and provided insight into their tissue-specific regulation of gene expression. In an exciting turn of events, new evidence is indicating that long ncRNAs are associated with enhancer regions and that such non-coding transcription correlate with the increased activity of the neighboring genes. Moreover, additional experiments suggest that enhancer-function can be mediated through a transcribed long ncRNA and that this might be a common function for long ncRNAs. Here, we review recent advances made both in the genome-wide characterization of enhancers and in the identification of new classes of long ncRNAs, and discuss the functional overlap of these two classes of regulatory elements.},

Although the vast majority of long noncoding RNAs have yet to be characterized thoroughly, many of these transcripts are unlikely to represent transcriptional "noise" as a significant number have been shown to exhibit cell type-specific expression, localization to subcellular compartments, and association with human diseases. Here, we highlight recent efforts that have identified a myriad of molecular functions for long noncoding RNAs. In some cases, it appears that simply the act of noncoding RNA transcription is sufficient to positively or negatively affect the expression of nearby genes. However, in many cases, the long noncoding RNAs themselves serve key regulatory roles that were assumed previously to be reserved for proteins, such as regulating the activity or localization of proteins and serving as organizational frameworks of subcellular structures. In addition, many long noncoding RNAs are processed to yield small RNAs or, conversely, modulate how other RNAs are processed. It is thus becoming increasingly clear that long noncoding RNAs can function via numerous paradigms and are key regulatory molecules in the cell.},

The RNA or RNP is first exposed to DMS under conditions that promote formation of the folded structure or complex, as well as 'control' conditions that do not allow folding or complex formation. The positions and extents of modification are then determined by primer extension, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantitative analysis. From changes in the extent of modification upon folding or protein binding (appearance of a 'footprint'), it is possible to detect local changes in the secondary and tertiary structure of RNA, as well as the formation of RNA-protein contacts.

abstract = {Prediction of RNA secondary structure by free energy minimization has been the standard for over two decades. Here we describe a novel method that forsakes this paradigm for predictions based on Boltzmann-weighted structure ensemble. We introduce the notion of a centroid structure as a representative for a set of structures and describe a procedure for its identification. In comparison with the minimum free energy (MFE) structure using diverse types of structural RNAs, the centroid of the ensemble makes 30.0\% fewer prediction errors as measured by the positive predictive value (PPV) with marginally improved sensitivity. The Boltzmann ensemble can be separated into a small number (3.2 on average) of clusters. Among the centroids of these clusters, the "best cluster centroid" as determined by comparison to the known structure simultaneously improves PPV by 46.5\% and sensitivity by 21.7\%. For 58\% of the studied sequences for which the MFE structure is outside the cluster containing the best centroid, the improvements by the best centroid are 62.5\% for PPV and 31.4\% for sensitivity. These results suggest that the energy well containing the MFE structure under the current incomplete energy model is often different from the one for the unavailable complete model that presumably contains the unique native structure. Centroids are available on the Sfold server at http://sfold.wadsworth.org.},

abstract = {Riboswitches are cis-acting gene-regulatory RNA elements that can function at the level of transcription, translation and RNA cleavage. The commonly accepted molecular mechanism for riboswitch function proposes a ligand-dependent conformational switch between two mutually exclusive states. According to this mechanism, ligand binding to an aptamer domain induces an allosteric conformational switch of an expression platform, leading to activation or repression of ligand-related gene expression. However, many riboswitch properties cannot be explained by a pure two-state mechanism. Here we show that the regulation mechanism of the adenine-sensing riboswitch, encoded by the add gene on chromosome II of the human Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus, is notably different from a two-state switch mechanism in that it involves three distinct stable conformations. We characterized the temperature and Mg(2+) dependence of the population ratios of the three conformations and the kinetics of their interconversion at nucleotide resolution. The observed temperature dependence of a pre-equilibrium involving two structurally distinct ligand-free conformations of the add riboswitch conferred efficient regulation over a physiologically relevant temperature range. Such robust switching is a key requirement for gene regulation in bacteria that have to adapt to environments with varying temperatures. The translational adenine-sensing riboswitch represents the first example, to our knowledge, of a temperature-compensated regulatory RNA element.},

abstract = {Background: Ribozymes can function as allosteric enzymes that undergo a conformational change upon ligand binding to a site other than the active site. Although allosteric ribozymes are not known to exist in nature, nucleic acids appear to be well suited to display such advanced forms of kinetic control. Current research explores the mechanisms of allosteric ribozymes as well as the strategies and methods that can be used to create new controllable enzymes. Results: In this study, we exploit the modular nature of certain functional RNAs to engineer allosteric ribozymes that are activated by flavin mononucleotide (FMN) or theophylline. By joining an FMN- or theophylline-binding domain to a hammerhead ribozyme by different stem II elements, we have identified a minimal connective bridge comprised of a G·U wobble pair that is responsive to ligand binding. Binding of FMN or theophylline to its allosteric site induces a conformational change in the RNA that stabilizes the wobble pair and ultimately favors the active form of the catalytic core. These ligand-sensitive ribozymes exhibit rate enhancements of more than 100-fold in the presence of FMN and of ∼40-fold in the presence of theophylline. Conclusions: An adaptive strategy for modular rational design has proven to be an effective approach to the engineering of novel allosteric ribozymes. This strategy was used to create allosteric ribozymes that function by a mechanism involving ligand-induced structure stabilization. Conceivably, similar engineering strategies and allosteric mechanisms could be used to create a variety of novel allosteric ribozymes that function with other effector molecules.},

In general, low SHAPE signal values indicate Watson-Crick base-pairing, and high values indicate positions that are single-stranded within the RNA structure. However, the relationship of SHAPE signals to structural properties such as non-Watson-Crick base-pairing or stacking has thus far not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we present results of SHAPE experiments performed on several RNAs with published three-dimensional structures. This strategy allows us to analyze the results in terms of correlations between chemical reactivities and structural properties of the respective nucleotide, such as different types of base-pairing, stacking, and phosphate-backbone interactions. We find that the RNA SHAPE signal is strongly correlated with cis-Watson-Crick/Watson-Crick base-pairing and is to a remarkable degree not dependent on other structural properties with the exception of stacking. We subsequently generated probabilistic models that estimate the likelihood that a residue with a given SHAPE score participates in base-pairing. We show that several models that take SHAPE scores of adjacent residues into account perform better in predicting base-pairing compared with individual SHAPE scores. This underscores the context sensitivity of SHAPE and provides a framework for an improved interpretation of the response of RNA to chemical modification.},

abstract = {Single-nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping for structured RNA is being rapidly advanced by new chemistries, faster readouts, and coupling to computational algorithms. Recent tests have shown that selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation by primer extension (SHAPE) can give near-zero error rates (0-2\%) in modeling the helices of RNA secondary structure. Here, we benchmark the method using six molecules for which crystallographic data are available: tRNA(phe) and 5S rRNA from Escherichia coli, the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme, and ligand-bound domains from riboswitches for adenine, cyclic di-GMP, and glycine. SHAPE-directed modeling of these highly structured RNAs gave an overall false negative rate (FNR) of 17\% and a false discovery rate (FDR) of 21\%, with at least one helix prediction error in five of the six cases. Extensive variations of data processing, normalization, and modeling parameters did not significantly mitigate modeling errors. Only one varation, filtering out data collected with deoxyinosine triphosphate during primer extension, gave a modest improvement (FNR = 12\%, and FDR = 14\%). The residual structure modeling errors are explained by the insufficient information content of these RNAs' SHAPE data, as evaluated by a nonparametric bootstrapping analysis. Beyond these benchmark cases, bootstrapping suggests a low level of confidence (<50\%) in the majority of helices in a previously proposed SHAPE-directed model for the HIV-1 RNA genome. Thus, SHAPE-directed RNA modeling is not always unambiguous, and helix-by-helix confidence estimates, as described herein, may be critical for interpreting results from this powerful methodology.},
